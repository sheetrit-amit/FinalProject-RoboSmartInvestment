## 🎯 Project Overview & Goals

[cite_start]The project aims to create a highly personalized and efficient investment management tool by addressing key market challenges[cite: 31, 32].

### Super Goal
[cite_start]The main objective is to enable **optimization of investment portfolios**, improve **risk management**, and implement **personalization** of investment strategies for every client[cite: 9].

### Core Problem Solved
The system provides a sophisticated solution to common challenges faced by investors:
* [cite_start]**Complexity and Information Overload:** Filtering and analyzing the vast amounts of financial data, market news, and economic reports[cite: 31].
* [cite_start]**Lack of Accessibility:** Providing high-quality, customized financial advice that is typically reserved for high-net-worth individuals[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]**Simplistic Existing Solutions:** Moving beyond "one-size-fits-all" robotic solutions that fail to properly balance personal nuances like required liquidity, ESG preferences, or specific long vs. short-term goals[cite: 34].

## ⚙️ Core Technology & Approach

[cite_start]The system employs a holistic approach combining quantitative finance with advanced AI techniques[cite: 37]:

### Key Components

1.  [cite_start]**AI Agents / LLMs (Large Language Models):** Utilized to scan and interpret diverse data (textual and financial) to identify opportunities and risks[cite: 38, 40].
2.  **Financial Optimization Models:** Core mathematical models used for portfolio construction. [cite_start]This includes **Markowitz Model** and **Linear Programming** to build optimal portfolios that balance risk and return[cite: 43, 45].
3.  [cite_start]**Machine Learning:** Used for automatic classification and initial filtering of companies and assets based on the user's profile[cite: 39, 41].
4.  [cite_start]**Data Processing Pipeline:** Essential for cleaning and standardizing raw market data to ensure model accuracy (addressing the "dirty data" challenge)[cite: 65].

### User Input & Personalization
[cite_start]The system begins with simple, focused user input via an intuitive interface[cite: 17, 18]:
* [cite_start]**Defined Risk Level:** Low, Medium, or High[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]**Preferred Sectors:** e.g., Technology, Energy, Health[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]**Asset Allocation Preferences:** e.g., mix between Government Bonds (stability), Corporate Bonds (higher yield), and Stocks (growth)[cite: 17].
